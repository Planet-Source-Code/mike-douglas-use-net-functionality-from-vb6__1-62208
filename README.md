This is a link to the MSDN site with a very interesting article on how to call .NET functionality from within VB6.<BR>.<BR>

Kinda weird...one of the nice things about VB6 is no dependancy on .NET library/download, but if thats not an issue for you, then check it out and let me know what you think..<BR>.<BR>
The .NET Framework Class Library provides extensive functionality for the following areas:.<BR>
New data types, such as GUID for working with Global Unique Identifiers, and TimeSpan – for working with a relative times (5 minutes instead of 12:05 AM 1/1/2005).<BR>.<BR>
Environment information – OS version, environment variables, command line arguments, machine name, user name, user domain, special folder paths, logical drives..<BR>.<BR>
Functionality for creating console (command line) applications.<BR>.<BR>
Functionality for writing Windows services
Registry access.<BR>.<BR>
Power events.<BR>.<BR>
Database access.<BR>.<BR>
Numerous types of collections, including sorted lists, dictionaries, and queues..<BR>.<BR>
Configuration file management.<BR>.<BR>
Operating system interaction – processes, event logs, performance counters, services, tracing and debugging.<BR>.<BR>
Active Directory access.<BR>.<BR>
Advanced graphics capabilities – drawing, gradients, images, printing.<BR>.<BR>
Access to COM+ services such as distributed transactions<BR><BR>
File system interaction and IO<BR><BR>
Windows Management Interface access<BR><BR>
Access to message queuing<BR><BR>
Low level network access – DNS lookups, IP Addresses, sockets, HTTP communication
Interoperability with non .NET code (known as unmanaged code)<BR><BR>
Reflection – allows late binding, and inspection of types at runtime<BR><BR>
Remote object access – creating instances of remote classes and calling their methods.<BR><BR>
Serialization – the ability to easily import/export the data of a class as XML.<BR><BR>
Cryptography – hashing, symmetric and asymmetric encryption, X509 certificates.<BR><BR>
Text formats – Conversions for ASCII, UTF-7, UTF-8, Unicode.<BR><BR>
Regular Expressions – The ability to insure that a string conforms to a certain pattern (the string looks like a phone number, IP address, e-mail address, etc.) The ability to extract sub-strings from a string (for example, extract all the HTML <A> tags).<BR><BR>
Threading - The ability to have an application do work in the background.<BR><BR>
